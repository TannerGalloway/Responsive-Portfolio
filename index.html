      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Tanner Galloway">

      <p>Over the years I have devloped a love/insterest in the subject of technology, more specificly web developemnt.
          As an eger junior web devloper I am highly adaptable and driven by learning.
          The appeal that web development has on me is having the ability to create a stunning website that not only looks good but
          functions as well as it looks. This is just one of the many reasons that development stood out to me.
        </p>

          <p>When I'm presented with a problem I am very Tenacious and have the desire to seek solutions to the given problem.
          This is the second reason that Development has stood out to me. I enjoy being challenged with different problems and
          I feel that coding is an acticity that keeps my insterest and challenges me at the same time. 
          If you would like to get to know me better feel free to contact me.
          
           </p>
